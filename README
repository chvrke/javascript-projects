# JavaScript Projects

A self-driven challenge to build **numerous JavaScript projects** over the course of a year to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, API integration, and more.

## üöÄ Purpose

This repository serves as a learning log and showcase of my progress through creating small to medium JavaScript-based projects. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, explore new concepts, and build a strong JavaScript foundation.

## üìÅ Project Structure

Each project will live in its own folder and include:

- `index.html` ‚Äì The main HTML structure  
- `style.css` ‚Äì Optional styling  
- `script.js` ‚Äì JavaScript logic  
- `README.md` ‚Äì Explanation per project  

Example:

```text
/100-javascript-projects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01-click-counter
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02-number-guessing-game
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
